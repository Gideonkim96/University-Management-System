In this lab, you will be a Java backend developer at one of the world's leading product engineering services companies. Recently, one of the top universities in the world allocated a big budget for modernizing and rebuilding their entire online University Registration, Enrollment and Management System, and they awarded this lucrative contract to your company. Your team has been tasked to deliver this full-stack solution which includes a beautiful and easy to use User Interface for students and university administrators, a solid backend following industry best practices, and most importantly, a well-designed Persistence Layer to store and manage all of the university's data in a Relational Database. While your teammates already did their part in building the front-end and laying the foundation for the backend using Java and Spring Boot, they left the most mission-critical part of designing and implementing the data layer to you. To completely decouple the Java backend implementation from the Relational Database technology and avoid managing SQL code, your Software Architect recommended using Hibernate ORM and JPA. He also recommended using H2 in-memory database to speed up the development and testing of your implementation. Your company relies on you to deliver this important project, bug-free, and production-ready for the coming school year at the university.
